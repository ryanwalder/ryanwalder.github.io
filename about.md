Hi there, I'm Ryan Walder. I'm a Linux systems administrator currently working for [Path Intelligence](http://www.pathintelligence.com/), I have always had a passion for technology and solving big, meaty problems. I'm a proponent of DevOps methodologies and the benefits they can bring to businesses (as well as making my nights quieter!), I am a big proponent of Open Source software and am active within the Open Source community.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Uses the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Written in [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), a modern fork of [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).

Thanks for reading!
